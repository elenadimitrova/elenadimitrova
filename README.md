### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» My name is Elena Gesheva and I am a Solidity developer with over 6 years of experience. 

âš¡ Fun fact: A hardfork coincided with my first day at work - it was 14th March 2016 and Homestead hardfork happened. 

ðŸ”­ When not writing Solidity code or helping the Ethereum community, I take interest in ethical hacking and making bread. Contributed original work on parameterized transaction reviews and upgradability of smart contracts. Presented at DevCon and TruffleCon events.

ðŸŒ± Previously I have helped buiild:

- [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)

Helped build the Ethereum <> Optimism bridge implementation.

Responsible for the Token list design and maintenance used by the Optimism Gateway https://gateway.optimism.io/

Led the project to redesign the platform documentation https://community.optimism.io/

Helped build better developer relations with external contributors and managed Gitcoin bounties for the organisation.

- [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/)

Working on the smart contracts that underpin the Argent wallet. Helped better organise the repo, CI and release processes. Also responsible for two major Solidity upgrades of the wallet 0.5-> 0.6 and 0.6->0.8 

Also contributed to the final major release refactoring of the wallet

- [Colony](https://colony.io/)

One of the two core developers that designed and implemented the first release of the Colony Network, named Glider. With over 35 contracts, 6000 lines of Solidity code and 12,000 lines of JavaScript in tests, it made for one of the most complex platforms engineered and running on Ethereum.
