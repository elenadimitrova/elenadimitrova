### Hi there 👋

💻 My name is Elena and I am a Solidity developer with 25 years of experience in software engineering of which 6 years in Ethereum. The Homestead hardfork coincided with my first official day at work - 14th March 2016.

🔭 When not writing Solidity code or helping grow the Ethereum community, I take interest in dancing, stargazing and making bread. Contributed original work on parameterized transaction reviews and upgradability of smart contracts. Presented at DevCon and TruffleCon events.

🌱 Previously I have helped build:

- [Sound](https://github.com/soundxyz/sound-protocol)
Contributed to the redesign of the sound protocol providing flexible yet efficient NFT drop creation and royalties distribution for  artists.

- [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)

Helped build the Ethereum <> Optimism bridge implementation.

Responsible for the Token list design and maintenance used by the Optimism Gateway https://gateway.optimism.io/

Led the project to redesign the platform documentation https://community.optimism.io/

Helped build better developer relations with external contributors and managed Gitcoin bounties for the organisation.

- [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/)

Working on the smart contracts that underpin the Argent wallet. Helped better organise the repo, CI and release processes. Also responsible for two major Solidity upgrades of the wallet 0.5-> 0.6 and 0.6->0.8 

Also contributed to the final major release refactoring of the wallet.

- [Colony](https://colony.io/)

One of the two core developers that designed and implemented the first release of the Colony Network, named Glider. With over 35 contracts, 6000 lines of Solidity code and 12,000 lines of JavaScript in tests, it made for one of the most complex platforms engineered and running on Ethereum.
